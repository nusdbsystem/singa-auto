Supported Tasks
===============

Each task has an associated a *Dataset Format*, a *Query Format* and a
*Prediction Format*.

A task's *Dataset Format* specifies the format of the dataset files.
Datasets are prepared by *Application Developers* when they create
*Train Jobs* and received by *Model Developers* when they define
singa\_auto.model.BaseModel.train and
singa\_auto.model.BaseModel.evaluate.

A task's *Query Format* specifies the format of queries when they are
passed to models. Queries are generated by *Application Users* when they
send queries to *Inference Jobs* and received by *Model Developers* when
they define singa\_auto.model.BaseModel.predict.

A task's *Prediction Format* specifies the format of predictions made by
models. Predictions are generated by *Model Developers* when they define
singa\_auto.model.BaseModel.predict and received by *Application Users*
as predictions to their queries sent to *Inference Jobs*.

IMAGE\_SEGMENTATION
-------------------

Dataset Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dataset-type:SEGMENTATION\_IMAGES

    **note**

    We use the same annotation format as `Pascal VOC segmentation
    dataset <http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/>`__

-  An image and its corresponding mask should have the same width and
   length while the number of channels can be different. For example, an
   image can have three channels representing ``RGB`` values but its
   mask should only have one grayscale channel.
-  In the mask image, each pixel's grayscale value represents its label,
   while the value ``255`` represents the pixel is meaningless such as
   paddings or borders.

Query Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~

An image file such as ``.jpg`` or ``.png``.

Prediction Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``W x H`` single-channel mask image with each pixel's grayscale value
representing its label.

IMAGE\_CLASSIFICATION
---------------------

Dataset Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dataset-type:IMAGE\_FILES

-  There is only 1 tag column of ``class``, corresponding to the class
   of the image as an integer from ``0`` to ``k - 1``, where ``k`` is
   the total no. of classes.
-  The train & validation dataset's images should be have the same
   dimensions ``W x H`` and same total no. of classes.

An example:

.. code:: text

    path,class
    image-0-of-class-0.png,0
    image-1-of-class-0.png,0
    ...
    image-0-of-class-1.png,1
    ...
    image-99-of-class-9.png,9

    **note**

    You can refer to and run
    `./examples/datasets/image\_files/load\_folder\_format.py <https://github.com/nusdbsystem/singa-auto/tree/master/examples/datasets/load_folder_format.py>`__
    for converting *directories of images* to SINGA-Auto's
    ``IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION`` format.

Query Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``W x H x 3`` 3D array representing a *RGB* version of the query
image. The query image can be of *any dimensions*.

Prediction Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A size-\ ``k`` array of floats, representing the probabilities of each
class, by index, from ``0`` to ``k-1``. For example, the float at index
0 corresponds to the probability of class 0.

POS\_TAGGING
------------

Dataset Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dataset-type:CORPUS

-  Sentences are delimited by ``\n`` tokens.
-  There is only 1 tag column of ``tag`` corresponding to the POS tag of
   the token as an integer from ``0`` to ``k-1``.

An example:

.. code:: text

    token       tag
    Two         3
    leading     2
    ...
    line-item   1
    veto        5
    .           4
    \n          0
    Professors  6
    Philip      6
    ...
    previous    1
    presidents  8   
    .           4
    \n          0

Query Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~

An array of strings representing a sentence as a list of tokens in that
sentence.

Prediction Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A array of integers representing the list of predicted tag for each
token, in sequence, for the sentence.

QUESTION\_ANSWERING
-------------------

COVID19 Task Dataset Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

dataset-type:QUESTION\_ANSWERING\_COVID19

Dataset can be used to finetune the SQuAD pre-trained Bert model.

-  The dataset zips folders containing JSON files. JSON files under
   different level folders will be automaticly read all together.

Dataset structure example:

    └──metadata.csv                                               # if additional information is provided for above JSON files, user can add a metadata.csv

-  JSON file includes ``body_text``, providing list of paragraphs in
   full body which can be used for question answering. ``body_text`` can
   contain different entries, only the "text" field of each entry will
   be read.

#. For JSON files extracted from papers, it comes that one JSON file for
   one paper. And if additional information is given in metadata.csv for
   papers, each JSON file and each metadata.csv entries are linked via
   ``sha`` values of both.
#. For dataset having their additional information paragraph, the
   ``body_text``> ``text`` entry is in
   ``<question> + <\n> + <information paragraph>`` string format. In
   this circumstance, there is no ``sha`` value nor metadata.csv file
   needed.

Sample of JSON file:

.. code:: text

    # JSON file 1                           # for example, a JSON file extracted from one paper
    {
        "sha": <str>,                       # 40-character sha1 of the PDF, this field is only required for JSON extracted from papers. it will be read into model in forms of string

        "body_text": [                      # list of paragraphs in full body, this is must-have
            {                               
                "text": <str>,              # text body for first entry, which is for one paragraph of this paper. this is must-have. it will be read as string into model
            }
            ...                             # other 'text' blocks, i.e. paragraphs blocks the same as above, then all string ‘text’ will be handled and processed into panda datafame
        ],
    }

    # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

    # JSON file 2                           # for example, a JSON file extraced from SQuAD2.0
    {        
        "body_text": [                      # list of paragraphs in full body, this is must-have
            {                               
                "text": 'What are the treatments for Age-related Macular Degeneration ?\n If You Have Advanced AMD Once dry AMD reaches the advanced stage, no form of treatment can prevent vision loss...',              
                                            # text body for first entry, this is must-have 

            },
            ...                             # other 'text' blocks, i.e. paragraphs blocks look the same as above
        ],
    }

-  ``metadata.csv`` is not strictly required. User can provide
   additional information with it, i.e. authors, title, journal and
   publish\_time, mapping to each JSON files by every sha value.
   ``cord_uid`` serves unique values serve as the entry identity. Time
   sensitive entry, is advised to have ``publish_time`` value in Date
   format. Other values, General format is recommended.

Query Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **note**

    -  The pretrained model should be fine-tuned with a dataset first to
       adapt to particular question domains when necessary.
    -  Otherwise, following the question, input should contain relevant
       information (context paragraph or candidate answers, or both),
       whether or not addresses the question.
    -  Optionally, while the relevant information as additional
       paragraph are provided in query, the question always comes first,
       followed by additional paragraph. We use “n” separators between
       the question and its paragraph of the input.

Query is in JSON format. It could be a \\ of a single question in
``questions`` field. Model will only read the ``questions`` field.
